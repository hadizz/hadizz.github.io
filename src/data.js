  bio: `<p>Hi, I’m Hadi Zare, Software
                <strong>Engineering student</strong> at Yazd
                University. As my first days in
                the Computer Engineering
                field, I felt that this is the
                dream I wanted when I was a
                child. So after practicing and
                <strong>teaching programming</strong> such
                as <strong>Java</strong> in the past two years, I
                found my passion in the front
                end developing in <strong>ReactJs</strong> &
                React Native. So now, I’m
                improving my skills in
                <strong>Frontend development</strong>. You
                can find my recent work on
